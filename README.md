Create a basic page with HTML (that introduces yourself to the world). Don't add any CSS or JS to it. 
Just focus on structuring your page using semantic HTML where possibleâ€Š. 
If you've already done something similar in the past, just add a link to any GitHub repo you have that can demonstrate this.
